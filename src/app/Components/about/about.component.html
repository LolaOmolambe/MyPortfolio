                  <strong>Hi there, I am Omolola Omolambe, a backend developer.
                    I'm a passionate introvert who enjoys building things that run on the web.
                    <br/>
                    <br />
                  For me, programming has become a part of my daily life. My journey began during my undergraduate internship where I watched a colleague automate a task using python.
                  The thought of being able to do that set me on my path.
                  After some months of learning, I discovered my passion for software development.
                  Since then, I have been honing my skills and collaborating with other developers to work on scalable technological solutions for various
                  enterprises.
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  Currently, I have strong technical proficiency in JavaScript and C# and also skilled in web technologies and frameworks such as .Net, NodeJs, Angular, SQL, MongoDB and HTML .
                  <br/>
                  As my passion for programming continues to grow daily, cloud computing has become my latest interest.
